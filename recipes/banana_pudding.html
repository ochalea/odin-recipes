    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>1 family size box [3.4oz] of Vanilla Jello pudding.</li>
            <li>2 cups of whole milk, even though the instructions call for 3 cups of milk.  Trust the process.   
                  If you use 2% or skim milk you might notice that the pudding is thinner.</li>
            <li>16 oz of cool whip thawed and divided.</li> 
            <li>1 box Vanilla Wafers</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the pudding mix with two cups of cold milk. Stir until the pudding begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a flexible spatula, fold the cool whip into the vanilla pudding.  Cover the pudding mixture and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes until the pudding 
                is just set. </li>
            <li>While the pudding is in the fridge, peel and slice the bananas into thin rounds and set aside until it&rsquo;s time to assemble. </li>
            <li>Assemble the banana pudding. In a casserole dish, trifle bowl or any large glass dish, start by layering Nilla wafers at the bottom. 
                Make sure to cover the entire surface with a single layer of wafers.</li>
            <li>Next,  place the banana rounds in a layer on top of the vanilla wafers. Make sure to evenly distribute the banana slices for consistent flavor 
                in each bite.</li>
            <li>Pour a layer of the prepared pudding mixture over the bananas. Use a spatula to spread it out, creating an even layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4-6 until you run out of space or ingredients.  Try to make the last layer a layer of pudding.</li>
            <li>Top the banana pudding with an even layer of Cool Whip, followed by some Vanilla wafers.</li>
            <li>Cover the banana pudding and refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
        </ol>
