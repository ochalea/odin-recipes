    <h2>Origins of Deep Dish Pizza</h2>
        <p>It was in Chicago that deep dish style pizza was created. The first deep dish pizza is believed to have 
           been created by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo in 1943 at their restaurant Pizzeria Uno (but the origin is debated). 
           The concept became wildly popular and Pizzeria Uno now has over 200 locations worldwide!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dough</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare pizza dough (half batch only) and sauce if using homemade.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).</li>
            <li>Next, coat a 10-inch cast iron skillet or round baking dish with olive oil and run a garlic clove around for seasoning 
                (NOTE: If using a 12-inch cast iron, the recipe should still work you'll just need to stretch the dough a bit more to fit the pan, 
                and use slightly more toppings).
                <p>Plop your dough down into the pan and push it up around the sides about 1 to 1.5 inches (see photo). 
                Let rest for a few minutes while preparing the rest of your toppings.</p></li>
            <li>First sprinkle in 1/2 of mozzarella cheese, then add veggies, then sauce. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese, Italian seasonings 
                (dried basil, oregano, thyme, red pepper, etc.) and grated parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese and sauce are bubbly. Let rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting, 
                then serve immediately. Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Or in the freezer up to 1 month.</li>
        </ol>
